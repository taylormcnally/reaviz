# Legends

---

REAVIZ supports two different types of legends:

- Discrete
- Sequential

Out of the box, none of the charts include legends because we want to
keep the library as modular as possible.

## Discrete Legend
The discrete legend is useful for categorical charts such as bar charts.
This legend supports supports both vertical and horizontal layout.

Below is a simple example of a discrete legend that has four different
labels.

```js
<DiscreteLegend
  orientation="horizontal"
  entries={[
    <DiscreteLegendEntry label="DLP" color="green" />,
    <DiscreteLegendEntry label="SIEM" color="blue" />,
    <DiscreteLegendEntry label="AWS" color="yellow" />,
    <DiscreteLegendEntry label="AD" color="purple" />
  ]}
/>
```

which would result in:

<Props of={DiscreteLegend} />

#### [DiscreteLegendEntry](https://github.com/jask-oss/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/legends/DiscreteLegend/DiscreteLegendEntry.tsx)
<Props of={DiscreteLegendEntry} />

#### [DiscreteLegendSymbol](https://github.com/jask-oss/reaviz/blob/master/src/common/legends/DiscreteLegend/DiscreteLegendSymbol.tsx)
<Props of={DiscreteLegendSymbol} />

## Sequential Legend
The sequential legend is useful for categorical charts such as heatmaps.
This legend supports supports both vertical and horizontal layout.

Below is a simple example of a sequential legend:

```js
<SequentialLegend
  data={
    [
      { key: 'Foo', data: 200 },
      { key: 'Bar', data: 0 }
    ]
  }
/>
```

which would result in the following:
